## 1. Finding Visually Attractive object using Hierarchical approach
Finding visually attractive region in an image is one of the interesting research area due to its real time applications. Generally
we take the images to capture objects (visually attractive region). In this paper the proposed approach regards the important object
detection in an image.[Read More](https://github.com/thoorpukarnakar/thoorpukarnakar.github.io/blob/master/Hierarchical_Clustering-main.pdf).
